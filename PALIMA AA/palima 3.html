<h1>Methodology</h1> <hr>
<p>This study utilizes an experimental research design to evaluate the effectiveness of a robotic device in managing fainting incidents within a hospital setting. The robotic device, ORION (Observational Robotic Intervention for Optimized Notifications), was developed and programmed with motion detection, image processing, and automated alert notification systems.
The evaluation was conducted in a controlled, hospital-like environment where simulated scenarios were created to represent individuals in motion, individuals experiencing fainting-related falls, and individuals remaining motionless for a period of 15 to 30 minutes. During each scenario, ORION continuously monitored the environment using its integrated camera and sensors to detect changes in posture and movement indicative of fainting incidents.
Once a fainting condition was detected, the device automatically initiated an emergency response by sending alerts to designated healthcare personnel. Data on detection accuracy, response time, and alert transmission speed were recorded and analyzed to determine the efficiency and reliability of the device. The results of these observations were used to assess ORION’s overall performance in improving the management of fainting incidents in hospital settings.
