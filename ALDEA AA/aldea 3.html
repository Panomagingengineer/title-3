<h1>Methodology</h1> <hr>
<p>This chapter evaluate how effectively the HydroScan prototype can detect rainfall pattern changes. The device collects numerical data on raindrop impact, rhythm, and frequency, which are then compared to official rainfall records. This approach allows the researchers to determine how accurate and reliable the prototype is in measuring rainfall behavior.
