<p>The study recommends the use of distributed series capacitors and shunt reactances to control no-load overvoltages in long-distance AC transmission lines. Numerical modeling should be preferred for very long lines where analytical solutions become complex or impractical. Future work should incorporate non-linear effects such as corona discharge, lightning transients, and alternative compensation strategies to further improve transmission stability.
