<h1>Methodology </h1> <hr>
<p> Electromagnetic wave effects in a long-distance high-voltage AC line were analyzed using telegrapher equations and a two-port network model, and validated through numerical FDTD-based simulation. Distributed series and shunt compensation were applied to reduce overvoltages.
