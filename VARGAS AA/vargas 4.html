<p>Results showed that electromagnetic wave propagation in long-distance AC lines causes significant no-load overvoltages due to capacitive and inductive effects. Overvoltage magnitude decreased as the number of compensation segments increased. For a 1200 km line, overvoltages were reduced from about 22% (4 segments) to approximately 10% (8 segments). Numerical results closely matched analytical predictions, with errors below 5%, confirming the accuracy and reliability of the proposed numerical model.
