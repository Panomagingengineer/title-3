<h1>recommendation</h1> <hr>
<p>Based on the interviews, observation, and conclusion of the study, the following recommendations are offered: <br>
  1. Further experimental study should be conducted to determine the shelf life of the edible straw made from mango skin, banana peel, and pineapple rind. <br>
  2. The taste of the edible straw must be improved to be acceptable to the teenager as well as to the kids. <br>
  3. Future researchers must conduct other experimental studies using other fruit peels.
